# Juliegit

a git clone thingy i originally wrote for [minus twelve](https://minustwelve.hackclub.com), but unforunately i couldn't pump out a working version before the deadline.  
currently the only working command is `init`, although the plan is to eventually recreate the rest of git's functionality and fix a few annoyances with git's UX(mainly how annoying dealing with remotes is)
